# Overview

Here is the JavaScript and C++ source code to my color cycling engine, written in 2010. I am releasing it under the [LGPL v3.0](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html). The package comes with one test LBM image, converted to JSON. The actual artwork shown in the demo is copyright, and cannot be used.
